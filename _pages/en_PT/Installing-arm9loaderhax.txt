The final Step of this guide is to install arm9loaderhax and setup Luma3DS to run just milliseconds into the boot. This is accomplished by using SafeA9LHInstaller by [AuroraWright](https://github.com/AuroraWright/).
{: .notice}

This will install [AuroraWright's Fork](https://github.com/AuroraWright/arm9loaderhax) of arm9loaderhax.

We gunna also setup th' ability to launch payloads from arm9loaderhax, givin' us th' ability to unbrick our SysNAND from situations that would normally brick us by restorin' from backup.

To use the [magnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet_URI_scheme) links on this page, you will need a torrent client like [Deluge](http://dev.deluge-torrent.org/wiki/Download)

#### Overview 'o steps

In this section, we will go through the process that all the other steps have led up to: actually installing arm9loaderhax.

This is nearly the best possible kind of device exploit because it is permanently installable into the NAND firm partitions, and runs before most of the OS loads, allowing it to not only work on *all* versions once installed, but also protect itself and recover from most situations that would brick a non-A9LH 3DS such as a nonfunctional home menu or bad title install.

The file `arm9loaderhax.bin` is what is launched by arm9loaderhax itself after it finishes loading off of NAND, and can be any valid arm9 payload. This file can be replaced at any time, although Luma3DS allows for the launch of other arm9 payloads using the Luma3DS chainloader.

In this case, we use Luma3DS by [AuroraWright](https://github.com/AuroraWright/) to boot a patched SysNAND directly, allowing us to completely bypass the need for any kind of EmuNAND, vastly simplifying the usage of a hacked 3DS in addition to saving SD card space.

Once arm9loaderhax be installed 'n Luma3DS be setup wit' th' correct options, we then restore our previous backup.

Durin' 'tis process, we also setup programs such as th' followin':    

+  **FBI** *(installs CIA formatted games 'n applications)*
+  **Luma3DS Updater** *(updates ye CFW installation easily)*
+  **GodMode9** *(multipurpose tool which can do NAND and cartridge functions)*

##### Section IV - Restorin' th' System

If, before followin' 'tis guide, ye already had an EmuNAND setup 'n would like to move th' contents 'o ye previous EmuNAND to ye new SysNAND CFW, now be th' time to [follow Move EmuNAND](move-emunand) instead 'o doin' th' first four steps in 'tis section.
{: .notice--info}

1. Boot your device while holding (Start) to launch the Luma3DS chainloader menu
1. Launch GodMode9 by pressing (A)

1. Press (A) on `<serialnumber>_nand.bin` to select it, then select "NAND image options...", then select "Restore SysNAND (safe)"
1. Press (A) to unlock SysNAND overwriting, then input the key combo given
  + This will not overwrite your arm9loaderhax installation
1. Input the key combo given to unlock SysNAND (lvl1) writing
  + This process will take some time
1. Press (A) to continue once it has completed
1. Press (Start) to reboot your device
  + If you get a black screen, [follow 9.2.0 CTRTransfer](9.2.0-ctrtransfer)
  + It is now safe to put New 3DSs in sleep mode again
1. If your backup was of a version between 3.0.0 and 4.5.0, your device will not boot until you manually download the required firmware:
  + Download [this file](http://nus.cdn.c.shop.nintendowifi.net/ccs/download/0004013800000002/00000056) and rename it to `firmware.bin`
  + Download [this file](http://nus.cdn.c.shop.nintendowifi.net/ccs/download/0004013800000002/cetk)
  + Copy `firmware.bin` 'n `cetk` to th' `/luma/` folder on ye SD card
  + Delete both of these files after updating your device
1. Update your device by going to System Settings, then "Other Settings", then going all the way to the right and using "System Update"
  + Updates while using A9LH + Luma (what you have) are safe
  + The warning about never updating a New 3DS from 2.1.0 does not apply after restoring your NAND backup.
  + If 'tis gives ye an error, set ye DNS settin's to "auto"
  + If this still gives you an error and your NAND is below 9.2.0, [follow 9.2.0 CTRTransfer](9.2.0-ctrtransfer)
