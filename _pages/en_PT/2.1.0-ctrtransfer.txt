If ye downgrade to 2.1.0 on a 2DS or New 3DS 'n left Wireless Communication off, ye can re-enable th' wireless by removin' th' battery 'n unpluggin' th' charger fer several seconds then bootin' back up.
{: .notice--info}

If you've been using the New 3DS's microSD Management to transfer files to your SD card, this will no longer work on 2.1.0. Ensure you have a microSD card reader available before proceeding.
{: .notice--info}

Your device may not show your installed games after the ctrtransfer. This is due to the tickets being removed by the transfer, which is why you back them up. They will be restored at the end of the guide.
{: .notice--info}

**For now, connecting your device to the internet is REQUIRED to continue after the 2.1.0 ctrtransfer.**
{: .notice--warning}

**Disable the parental controls of your device before doing the 2.1.0 ctrtransfer. If you do not know the password, see [this](https://mkey.salthax.org/) site.**
{: .notice--warning}

**Performing a ctrtransfer will remove all user-installed tickets from the device until a backup is restored. Under NO CIRCUMSTANCES should you skip creating a backup!**
{: .notice--danger}

**Never format a 2DS while on a version <6.0.0 or you will be unable to complete initial setup and will BRICK!**
{: .notice--danger}

**Never update a New 3DS running 2.1.0 (an Old 3DS firmware) or you will BRICK! You MUST restore a NAND backup or ctrtransfer back to standard New 3DS firmware first!**
{: .notice--danger}

{% capture notice %}
**Putting a New 3DS on 2.1.0 in sleep mode is known to cause an UNRECOVERABLE brick!**
**This only happens when shutting the lid _while the device is on_; this does not apply to turning the device off.**
**The device only enters sleep mode when the lid is closed. It is not on a timer or anything like that.**
**Once on 2.1.0, you should continue without delay to avoid any possibility of this happening!**

#### Overview 'o steps

In 'tis section, we gunna be flashin' ye console's [CTRNAND](https://www.3dbrew.org/wiki/Flash_Filesystem#CTR_partition) partition to 2.1.0 in order to take advantage 'o an oversight in 2.1.0 fer th' purpose 'o extractin' th' [OTP](https://www.3dbrew.org/wiki/OTP_Registers) unique to ye console. This OTP file is required to install arm9loaderhax, and **cannot** be shared with other consoles.

This is accomplished by [installing a premade ctrtransfer image](https://www.reddit.com/r/3dshacks/comments/4zhe4a/) containing 2.1.0, copying your console specific files (such as `moveable.sed` and `SecureInfo_A`) to it, then fixing the title databases.

#### What ye need

* Ye gunna need to have booted into Decrypt9
* Th' 2.1.0 ctrtransfer image fer ye device 'n region     
*(if your device is not from one of these regions, just pick one)*:
