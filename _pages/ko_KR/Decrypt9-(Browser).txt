The first thing this guide will do is get you running Decrypt9, which is a multipurpose toolkit that will allow us to install the version 2.1.0, which contains a vulnerability that is needed for further exploitation of the system.

이 가이드는 SysNAND 기준으로 제작되었으므로 EmuNAND 기반의 커스텀 펌웨어 3DS를 보유한 경우 모든 과정을 SysNAND에 적용하세요. EmuNAND와 RedNAND는 [동일한 개념](http://3dbrew.org/wiki/NAND_Redirection)을 다른 방식으로 구현한 것입니다.

#### 준비물

* 최신 버전의 [Decrypt9WIP](https://github.com/d0k3/Decrypt9WIP/releases/latest)

#### Instructions

1. Create a folder named `files9` on the root of your SD card if it does not already exist
2. Copy `Launcher.dat` and `Decrypt9WIP.dat` from the Decrypt9WIP `.zip` to the root of your SD card
3. Reinsert your SD card into your 3DS
4. Open the browser and go to one of the following URLs on your 3DS
  + `https://dukesrg.github.io/?Decrypt9WIP.dat`
  + `http://go.gateway-3ds.com/`
  + `http://www.reboot.ms/3ds/load.html?Launcher.dat`
  + `http://dukesrg.dynu.net/3ds/rop?GW17567.dat&Launcher.dat`
  + Make sure to try each URL if the first one doesn't work (some versions cannot use the first one, and some versions cannot use the last three)
  + If you get an error, [follow this troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting#ts_browser)
5. If the exploit was successful, you will have booted into Decrypt9

Continue to [2.1.0 ctrtransfer](2.1.0-ctrtransfer).
