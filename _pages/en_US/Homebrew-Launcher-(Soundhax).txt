#### What you need

<div id="files" markdown="1">
+ The Homebrew [Starter Kit](http://smealum.github.io/ninjhax2/starter.zip)
+ The latest release of [SoundHax](http://soundhax.com/) *(for your device and region)*
+ The [otherapp payload](https://smealum.github.io/3ds/#otherapp) *(for your version and region)*
</div>

#### Instructions

1. Copy _the contents of_ the `starter` folder in `starter.zip` to the root of your SD card
2. Copy the SoundHax `.m4a` to the root of your SD card
3. Copy the otherapp payload to the root of your SD card and rename it to `otherapp.bin`
4. Reinsert your SD card into your 3DS
5. Launch Nintendo 3DS Sound
6. Go through all of the bird tips, then close the app normally and reopen it
  + Launching SoundHax immediately would cause these tips to appear on every launch of the Nintendo 3DS Sound until this is done
7. Go to `/SDCARD`, then play "<3 nedwill 2016"
  + This may take many tries
  + If it freezes, just force the console to power off by holding the power button, then try again
8. Your console should load the Homebrew Launcher
