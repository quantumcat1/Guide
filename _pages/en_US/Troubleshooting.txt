## <a name="gw_fbi" />Cannot inject H&S on Gateway downgraded device
This is caused by Gateway implementing a very shoddy downgrade method, which leaves two versions of each app on the system. One of them is unused, but it confuses Decrypt9, causing it to inject into the wrong one.

## <a name="ts_browser" />A browser based exploit is not working
Browser based exploits (such as browserhax or 2xrsa) are often unstable and crash frequently, but they can sometimes be fixed by doing the following steps

1. Open the browser, then open the browser settings
2. Scroll to the bottom and Initialize Savedata (it also may be called Clear All Save Data)
3. Try the exploit again

## <a name="ts_safe_a9lh" />System boots directly SafeA9LHInstaller
You copied the wrong `arm9loaderhax.bin` file to your SD card (you were only supposed to copy the `3ds` folder and `SafeA9LHInstaller.dat` file from the SafeA9LHInstaller zip)    

1. Use the correct `arm9loaderhax.bin`
2. Copy `arm9loaderhax.bin` from the Luma3DS `.zip` to the root of your SD card
3. Reboot holding (Select) and continue

## <a name="ts_safe_a9lh_screen" />SafeA9LHInstaller shows a glitched screen
This happens occasionally, but the reason is unknown. The buttons will still work, but the screen will be glitched looking

1. Follow instructions as normal
2. Press (Select) and arm9loaderhax will be installed
3. Wait a few seconds
4. Shut down your console by pressing any button

## <a name="ts_d9_backup" />Decrypt9 or Hourglass9 won't restore / can't find my NAND backup

1. Make sure you do not have any folder named "Decrypt9" on **the root** of your SD card
2. Try checking your SD card for errors using [H2testw (Windows)](h2testw-(windows)), [F3 (Linux)](f3-(linux)), or [F3X (Mac)](f3x-(mac))
3. Try backing up your SD card files, then formatting it and copying them back
4. Try a different SD card

## <a name="ts_sys_down" />Black screen on SysNAND boot

1. Try booting with your SD card out, and then reinserting it after booting.
    1. Power off your 3DS by holding down the power button.
    2. Take out the SD card.
    3. Power on the 3DS.
    4. When the home menu appears, reinsert your SD card.
    5. If this worked, you should Clear Home Menu's extdata by navigating to the following folder on your SD card: `/Nintendo 3DS/(32 Character ID)/(32 Character ID)/extdata/00000000/`
        + EUR Region: Delete `00000098`
        + JPN Region: Delete `00000082`
        + USA Region: Delete `0000008f`
        + KOR Region: Delete `000000A9`
2. Try booting without any cartridges inserted (including flashcarts)
3. If you have a hardmod and a NAND backup, flash the backup back to SysNAND.
4. Try booting into recovery mode and updating your system.    
    *This probably will not work for an Old 3DS downgraded to 2.1.0*    
    **This will BRICK a New 3DS downgraded to 2.1.0**
    1. Power off your 3DS by holding down the power button.
    2. Hold (L)+(R)+(A)+(Up).
    3. Power on the 3DS.
    4. If you enter safe mode, update your 3DS *only if you have an entrypoint for the latest FW version and it is possible to downgrade from it* and attempt the downgrade again.
5. Your 3DS may be bricked. For support, ask for help at [#3dshacks on Rizon IRC](https://www.reddit.com/r/3dshacks/wiki/irc) or [3DS Hacking on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp).
